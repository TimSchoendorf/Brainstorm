## 3. Architectural Goals and Contstraints
Brainstorm's most important architectural goal is to offer a good usability to the users, as we want the user to have a pleasant and enjoyable time while using the application.
Our way to accomplish this goal is to have a good looking and feeling user interface as well as linking it with other architectural goals like availabilty on different devices and security.
Usability also means that no apparent faults in the system should exist.
