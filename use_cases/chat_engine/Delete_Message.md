# Use-Case Specification: Deleting a message

# 1. Deleting a message

## 1.1 Brief Description
While there can be a lot of constructive things in a chat, sometimes there is stuff you don't need or want to outright remove for reasons.
Therefore you can delete your own messages and if you have the appropriate role, even remove the ones of others.
